          <p> "My car was so filthy between many months of eating in the car, my dog and plus i'm a door dasher so I
            spend a lot of time in
            my car. I came across TopLux IG page and decided to book a detail. First of all, she was friendly and
            communicated what i was getting
            very well and of course the end results had me shocked! It looked cleaner than before I bought it from the
            dealer and to mention it smelled
            soooooo good after. I really do recommend her services."</p>

          <p>"I received a mini interior detail because this is my second time going to her, so i just get upkeeping
            now. But, its
            worth the price! The shine and the smell after its done is so good its like im addicted. I also got a car
            wash, everything was
            just shining. Go to her!"

          <p>"I have two teenager boys, a toddler and a baby, you know where this is going. I honestly was going to get
            a new car
            because that is how wrecked and dirty my car was, literally years of filth. I was her first customer ever so
            it took me
            by surprise how good she made my truck look, I literally cried because as a mother of 4 I just didnt have
            the time to
            to keep up with it. She recommended me to schedule a mini detail about once a month to keep up the
            cleaniless and I will be
            doing that for sure."

          <p>"I don't really have a terribly dirty car, I usually keep up with trash and items inside of it but as far
            dust and some grime I dont usually pay it any mind until my husband told me to schedule an appointment with
            a
            detailer so it wouldn't get worse. luckily, my friend told me about her so it took the time out of having to
            research.
            Between the inside getting wiped down and my seats and floors shampooed and the way it looked I really
            thought my car was
            not that bad until it was done. I had to get a car wash, it just didn't feel complete without it and BOY was
            there a lot of dirt.
            I'm very pleased with my services."

          <p>"My wife and I are very heavy smokers and its a bad habit doing it inside of our cars. I knew because we
            couldn't see it
            doesn't mean it's not embedded in our seats and floors, plus we are used to the smell. Someone made a
            comment about it
            and at the moment i was like yeahh its time to get a detail and cut the habit! She spent quite some time
            shampooing our seats
            and carpet, she even wanted us to come look at how much of the filth was coming up over and over again,
            recommended that we
            stop smoking inside the vehicle and to schedule services one to two times a month until it was completely
            up, then follow by
            monthly mini detailing to keep it clean and fresh. I love that she educated us on taking care of our cars
            and the honesty. 10/10
            very happy client!"</p>
